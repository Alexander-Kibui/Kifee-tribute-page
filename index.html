		<h1>Mr.Lambistic Kibuika </h1>
		<p>If you are looking for realness, a person that can tell you with a straight face like it is, then Andrew Kibe is your guy. He doesn't mince words when talking about controversial topics and giving people the undesired truth. Andrew is a media personality, vlogger, blogger, and so much more. He is a free thinker and does not shy away from sharing his mind, tackling controversial topics that many shun. Over time, Andrew, because of his genuine rants that expound on contentious issues, has earned hundreds of followers on his social media handles. Perhaps you knew him from his "roof-top" days where he used to give controversial personalities a piece of his mind while demystifying certain societal norms.<br><br> 
			Andrew attended the same high school with Senator Mutula Kilonzo Jr and was part of the same gang. This was Nairobi Millimani School that people could hardly differentiate from Nairobi School then. Andrew's group was known to be very fashionable and would adorn cool clothes that looked like school attire. It is not certain what Andrew Kibe did after high school, but he has an exciting career. Many people were shocked to find out that Kibe was once a pastor and a great friend to Robert Burale, the celebrity pastor.
